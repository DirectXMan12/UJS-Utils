h1. UJS Utils

h2. Overview

UJS Utils ([_ujs-utils_]) is a piece (or rather several pieces) of utility Javascript code that attempt to pick up where the base Rails UJS code left off and implement some of the basic functionality from the old RJS in the new UJS style.

h2. Requirements
* [*In short:*]_none!_
* Specifically, and in more detail:
** _Almost_ none
*** This library uses the "Prototype":http://prototypejs.org/ framework, which is included in the library, but you _must_ include it in your page script includes
*** This library also uses the "Script.aculo.us":http://script.aculo.us/ framework, which I have not included in the repository (for some reason unbeknownst to even me).  That _must_ also be included in your page script includes.
*** Finally, you *_must_* include `rails_ujs_prototype_boilerplate.js` (courtesy of "Rails":http://rubyonrails.org) and `my_ujs.js`

h2. Other versions
Currently, this only works for Prototype.  However, if anyone is interested in a JQuery version, drop me a message, and I will attempt to code one.  Finally, if you write one yourself, send me a pull request and I will include it, as long as it maintains the same style and functionality of the Prototype version

h2. Example

See test_page.html for an example.  It expects a response provided by config.ru (run `rack -p 9292 config.ru`), but that is just for the example page, not the library
